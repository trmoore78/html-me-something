      <h2>Cakes, Cakes, Cakes!!!</h2>
      <span>Hello, my name is Torrie Moore.  I have a wordpress page by the name of "Words From My Kitchen" that talks about my greatest inspiration for cooking and just in general, 
        my grandmother.  With this class, I thought I would try to recreate this page using the lessons that are being taught.</span>
      <p>One of those inspirations involves baking.  I love baking cakes.  I guess you could see that it is sort like coding.  This is because you have so many different ingredients 
        that can be combined to create one beautiful thing.  For me, that thing is <em>CAKE</em>!</p>

      <h3>Red Velvet Cheesecake Cake</h3></div>

      <div id="Red Velvet Cheesecake Cake Intro">
           <p>For Valentine's Day, I made a heart-shaped Red Velvet Cheesecake Cake. One of my favorite desserts
           that my grandmother made for me was a Red Velvet Cake. So, of course, when I went to The Cheesecake Factory
           and saw a Red Velvet Cheesecake Cake, my mouth drooled. It combined two of the best desserts, Red Velvet Cake 
           and Cheesecake. With that being said, the research began to see what all went into making the cheesecake. 
           After much trial and error (a lot of trial and error), I now use the below recipe for it.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Recipe/Ingredients">
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>2 -- 8 oz. packages of cream cheese</li>
        <li>2/3 cup granulated white sugar</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp of salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/3 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>2/3 tbsp vanilla extract</li>
      </ul>

      <p>After mixing all of the ingredients together, I pour the cheesecake in a greased pan that was 
        lined with parchment paper. Then I place it in a â€œwater bath" and bake for about 55 minutes. 
        The time would probably vary depending on how your oven cooks. The oven temperature that I use 
        is 325 degrees.</p>
